How to Use
------

Use `git` to clone the M.S. thesis template:

    git clone https://github.com/thomasgredig/MSthesis-template

As the compiler use `miktex` with the appropriate GUI, on Mac that would probably be `TeXShop` and on Windows, it would be `WinShell`. If you do not want to worry about compilers
you can use the [OverLeaf environment](http://www.overleaf.com) online and upload these files. Moreover, for tables an online generator is
really useful, such as [TableGenerator](http://www.tablegenerator.com).

Steps:
+ configure `myConfig.tex`
+ try to compile `MS-thesis.tex`
+ add figures into folders `FIGS`
+ add bibliography file (export from Zotero)
+ Complete the files in the manuscript folder
+ compile.
